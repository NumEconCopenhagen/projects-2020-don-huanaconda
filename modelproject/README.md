# Model analysis project

For the following project, we consider the exam in Microeconomics I from 2019, winter. We wish to solve problem 2 and 3. 

We solve the utility maximization problem given a particular utility function. First, we find a general solution and map the indifference curves for certain levels of utility. Thereafter, we find optimal solutions for given levels of Income and prices.

Given a production function and certain cost_structure we solve a firm's profit maximization problem and find the firm's optimal quantity produced. Furthermore, given, price, factor prices and fixed costs we find the optimal conditional factor demands of labour, $l$, and capital, $k$, the optimal quantity and subsequent profit.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
