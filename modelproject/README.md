# Model analysis project

For the following project, we consider the exam in Microeconomics I from 2019, winter. We wish to solve problem 2 and 3. 

We solve the utility maximization problem given a particular utility function. First, we find a general solution and map the indifference curves for certain levels of utility. Thereafter, we find optimal solutions for given levels of Income and prices.

Given a production function and certain cost_structure we solve a firm's profit maximization problem and find the firm's optimal quantity produced. Furthermore, given, price, factor prices and fixed costs we find the optimal conditional factor demands of labour and capital as well as the optimal quantity and subsequent profit.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
