# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **The outbreak of COVID-19 in selected countries** and considers the spread of COVID-19 in 5 selected countries. In order to combat the outbreak of COVID-19, the analyzed countries have adopted several approaches varying in strictness. The approaches aim to avoid exponential growth in the spread of COVID-19. In our case, exponential growth would occur when every contaminated individual infects *more* than 1 person. This in particular is analyzed graphically. Descriptives are included for a brief inspection of the data.

The financial impact of the pandemic is briefly discussed and analyzed graphycally in the United States using data for the S&P500 index in the considered period.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loads the following two datasets**

1. COVID-19 data from the European Center for Disease Control
