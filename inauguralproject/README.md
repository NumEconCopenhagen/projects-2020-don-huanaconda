# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

Given certain patameter values, tax rates and wage levels the program attached computed the supply of labour and consumption. By imposing changes within the wage levels, it is concluded that both labour supply and consumption is increasing in the wage rate. Moreover, we conclude that tax revenue is decreasing in the Frisch elasticity of labour supply. 

Maximizing tax revenue can be politically motivated; given the circumstances and with the goal of maximizing tax revenue, we compute the optimal standard income tax rate, top bracket income tax rate as well as a cut-off for the top labour income tax bracket.
